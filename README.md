# Tooling
Anything and everything i find interesting and want to use in multiple projects :
- Grading : Simple class including itself used as a tree of categories representing academic disciplines (mathematics, history...).
- Inventory : A framework used to manage inventories in games.
- Stats : A framework allowing management and interaction of statistics of characters in games.
